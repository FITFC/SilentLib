# Silent Lib

A common library for my Minecraft mods to use, to making updating and creating new mods easier.

## Links and Downloads

- [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/silent-lib) (downloads and more information)
- [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Adyk9zHnUn) (easiest way to get quick questions answered, do not use to report bugs)

### Note on Downloads

**I only upload builds to Minecraft CurseForge.** If you downloaded the mod from somewhere other than CurseForge, I cannot make any guarantees about the file or its contents, as it was uploaded without my permission.
